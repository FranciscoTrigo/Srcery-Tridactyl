# Srcery-Tridactyl

This is a try at adapting the awesome [Srcery](https://srcery-colors.github.io/) color scheme for the amazing [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) plugin for the FireFox browser.  
This is WIP at the moment and so far I only replaced the color definitions of one of themes available at [bezmi's repository](https://github.com/bezmi/base16-tridactyl) for Tridactyl themes (they all are pretty cool! Go look at them!)
